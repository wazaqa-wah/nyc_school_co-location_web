					<h2>What is co-location?</h2>
					<p>
						Co-locations are the term for NYC schools with at least one other school in a shared building. These schools share spaces like gym, cafeteria, as well as classrooms.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Why co-location?</h2>
					<p id = "normalText">NYC introduced the idea of co-location around 1989 as a way to pushed for smaller schools and more school choices. Back then, more and more kids are going to school, which soon drive up the student-teacher ratio. To increase student performance and make teachers' job easier, public charter schools are introduced.</p>

						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p>2190 schools are in the NYC Department of Education as of fall 2021, and according to the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2019-2020-Co-Location-Report/ugqd-j3dx" target="_blank">2019-2020 Co-location Report</a>, 1079 schools that are co-located.</p>

					<h2>Does co-location has an impact on public school performance?</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>The big question</h2>
					<p id = "normalText">While charter schools are introduced as a way to improve student performance at public school, does this have an actual impact? </p>	
					<p id = "normalText">With 53% charter schools being co-located with public schools, I am curious to see if being co-located has an effect on the student performance of these public schools.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Linear Regression</h2>
					<p>Of course, many things can impact a school's performance:</p>	
					<ul>
						<li>Student demography</li>
						<li>School location</li>
						<li>Parents demogrpahy</li>
						<li>Funding</li>
						<li>etc...</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p id = "normalText">For the purpose of this study, we will use linear regression as a method. This is a linear approach for modeling the relationship between a independent variables and one or more explanatory dependent variables.</p>
					<p id = "normalText">My independent variable will be factors that reflect a school's performance, which is listed on the next slide.</p>	
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Dependent Variables</p>
					<p class="fragment" id = "importantText">Elementary and middle school</p>
					<p id = "normalText"><span class="fragment" >Rate of change for English Language Arts (ELA) score and Math Score between 2013-2019</span> </p>
					<p id = "importantText"><span class="fragment" >High School</span> </p>
					<p id = "normalText"><span class="fragment" > Rate of change for 4 year and 6 year graudation rate for student cohort between 2013-2019.</span></p>

				</section>

				<section>
					<p id = "importantText">My independent variable would be:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Enrollment (rate of change)</li>
						<li>Student with disability (rate of change)</li>
						<li>Poverty (rate of change)</li>
						<li>English language learner (rate of change)</li>
						<li>Economic Needs Index (2019 number)</li>
						<li>Borough of the school location</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p id = "importantText">So how to interpret the result?</p>
					<p id = "normalText">R-squred => Closer to one, the better the predicted line describes the relationship between the variables.</p>
					<p id = "normalText">P-value => Smaller than 0.05 is statistically significant, which means we can reject null hypothese.</p>
					<p id = "normalText">Estimates => with 1 unit increase in the independent variable, how much will the dependent variable increase/decrease.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>One thing to keep in mind</h3>
					<p class="fragment">The data for my dependent variable is </p>
					<p><span class="fragment">not</span> </p>
					<p><span class="fragment">normally distrubuted!</span> </p>
					
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Which means this method is not for me to predict student performance, but to find out if co-located or not has an impact for student performance.</p>
					<p>Focusing on the P-value for public schools that are co-located</p>	
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Elementary and Middle School</h2>
					<p id = "normalText">lm(cbind(ela, math) ~ coLocated + borough + econNeed + disability + englishLanguageLearn + poverty + enrollment)</p>
					<table id = "resultTable">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Score</th>
								<th>Multiple R-squared</th>
								<th>P-value (co-locatedTRUE)</th>

								<td class = "estimate">1.065515</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p id = "normalText">For public elementary and middle school, it is interesting to see that being co-located has a positive impact on the 2 scores, especially for Math. The R-squared is small, so we can't say for sure if the p-value and estimates are correct, but the trend is clear.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>High School</h2>
					<p id = "normalText">lm(cbind(4year, 6year) ~ coLocated + borough + econNeed + disability + englishLanguageLearn + poverty + enrollment)</p>
					<table id = "resultTable">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Score</th>
								<th>Multiple R-squared</th>
								<th>P-value (co-locatedTRUE)</th>
								<th>Estimate (Rate of change)</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>4year</td>
								<td class = "rSquare">0.088894</td>
								<td class = "pValue">0.007333</td>
								<td class = "estimate">-0.09379</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>6year</td>
								<td class = "rSquare">0.05494</td>
								<td class = "pValue">0.00594</td>
								<td class = "estimate">-0.047348</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p id = "normalText">For high schools, I didn't choose to have booleans co-located true or false to interact with Borough, rather to just take it into account. This is because even though the R-squared value is better when it's interacting, the P-value for co-located being true also changed a lot. Knowing that the data is not normally distributed, the increase in R-squared value is probably caused by the model being overfitted, which is not what we want.</p>
